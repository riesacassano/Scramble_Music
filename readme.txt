Welcome! This readme provides an overview of the data and materials in this repo. These materials (plus all musical stimuli) are also on OSF here: https://osf.io/mej7a/

Each subfolder also contains its own readme with more information.

'Primary data/' contains the raw data as we got it from Labvanced, as well as an aggregate version with accuracies calculated for experiments 1, 2, and 4. We have removed Prolific IDs to ensure anonymity.

'Experiments 1 2 4-Memory Prediction Categorization/' contains the data and analysis scripts needed to generate figures 2, 5, and 6 and the results for experiments 1, 2, and 4. The analysis for these experiments was straightforward and similar enough that it made sense to group them into one folder.

'Experiment 3-Event Segmentation/' contains data and analysis scripts needed to generate figures 3 and 4 and the results for experiment 3. It has two different processed versions of the data. We kept the internal IDs consistent ('exp_subject_id') so participants' data could be matched across the Primary data and the processed versions.
