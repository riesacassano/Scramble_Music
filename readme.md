'primary_data/' contains the raw data as we got it from Labvanced. We have removed Prolific IDs to ensure anonymity. Raw data is wrangled in various scripts and saved in `E1-E2-E4/` and `E3/`

'E1-E2-E4/' contains the data and analysis scripts needed to generate figures 2, 5, 6, and S1 and the results for experiments 1 (memory), 2 (prediction), and 4 (categorization). The analysis for these experiments was straightforward and similar enough that it made sense to group them into one folder.

'E3/' contains data and analysis scripts needed to generate figures 3 and 4 and the results for experiment 3 (event segmentation).
