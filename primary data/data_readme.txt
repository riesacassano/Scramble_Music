Primary data readme

For experiments 1, 2, and 4, and dataset 3A, each participant has its own .xlsx file in 'completedSubjects/'. Files are labeled with the participants internal ID ('exp_subject_id' or 'Labvanced ID') which is consistent across the primary and aggregate data. For each participant there is the data from Labvanced, as well as accuracy computed per condition and overall accuracy and average reaction times for each condition (prediction and memory only). These are recorded in 'aggregate data (all completedSubjects)', and this aggregate dataset is used for analysis in experiments 1, 2, and 4. Raw and analyzed data are typically on two different sheets in the .xlsx file, but some participants have two files (.csv and .xlsx for example) - one with the raw data and one with the analyzed data.

When participants were recruited, they were assigned to a group, and we balanced the number of musicians and non-musicians in each group. Groups 1-3 completed the memory and event segmentation tasks, groups 4-6 completed the memory and categorization tasks, groups 7-9 completed the prediction and event segmentation tasks, and groups 10-12 completed the prediction and categorization tasks. (Memory/prediction were always completed before segmentation or categorization.) Within a task (e.g. memory), all stimuli were taken from the same stimulus set, but the stimulus set used for the second task (e.g. categorization) was different from the set used for the first task. Each group heard a different combination of stimulus sets.

For dataset 3B, all participants' data is recorded in 'dataset 3B raw.csv'. (This was also obtained directly from Labvanced.) Participants' data from dataset 3A and 3B were combined and filtered to obtain the filtered data used for experiment 3 ('../Experiment 3-Event Segmentation/data/timestamps_filtered_long.csv' and '../Experiment 3-Event Segmentation/data/response_rate_by_sub.csv').
